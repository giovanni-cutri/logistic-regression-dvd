    "More generally, while a classic regression model assumes that the response variable follows a normal distribution, in a generalized linear model its distribution could be any other: in the case of logistic regression, it's the Bernoulli distribution. A random variable with a Bernoulli distribution can take on two values only, which we can numerically encode as 0 or 1, and the only parameter is *p*, the probability of success, that is the probability that the random variable takes on the value 1."

    "The coefficients of the explanatory variables estimated in a logistic regression give important indications regarding how the values of the regressors affect the value taken by *y*. Their interpretation is a bit different from the classic regression, though, for the following reason: since the values of a linear combination of the regressors with the coefficients can take on any real value, this model is not adequate to accurately describe the values taken on by *y*. To solve this problem, the linear combination gets modified by the *logistic function*, which normalizes its value so that it is included between 0 and 1."

    "With these assumptions, for each unit increase in the value of a regressor, the odds of success vary by *e<sup>$\\beta$</sup>*, where $\\beta$ is the corresponding coefficient. Thus, given a positive coefficient, the variation will increase the chance of success, pushing the explained variable to a value closer to 1; conversely, given a negative coefficient, the variation will decrease the chance of success, pushing the explained variable to a value more distant to 1."
